Playing with the Backblaze HDD Failure Data

HDD Failure data is interesting to me, and Backblaze has openly published about 7 years (so far) worth of data on their hard drive failures, as well as SMART data from the drives.

You can find the raw data here: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html.
