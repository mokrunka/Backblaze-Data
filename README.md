Playing with the Backblaze HDD Failure Data

HDD Failure data is interesting to me, and Backblaze has openly published about 7 years (so far) worth of data on their hard drive failures, as well as SMART data from the drives.

You can find the raw data here: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html.

Note that in order to run the code in this repo, you'll need to have downloaded the datasets (you don't have to download
all of them if you don't want), and will have to modify the code to point to the location on your local machine where you
have the data stored. See code for comments and guidance on this.

If there's enough interest, maybe I'll make a version that asks you to put in the correct directory, so you don't have to
hard-code it.
